# CST8277 Assignment #1 - Bouncing Sprites
This assignment's purpose was to introduce the concept of threads, multithreading, and the producer/consumer problem. The program consists of a window with a black square inside the window. When you click on the window, a blue Sprite is created that moves around the window and bounces off the edges. Each Sprite has its own thread, and no more than two Sprites can be inside the black square. If two Sprites are in the square and another Sprite tries to enter, using thread sychronization the two inside will continue their movement until they exit, while all other Sprites will freeze at the edge and wait for their turn to enter the square.
